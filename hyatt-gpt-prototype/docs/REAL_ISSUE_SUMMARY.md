# The Real Issue - Why Agents Ignore Campaign Briefs

## Problem Discovered

When you submitted a campaign about an airline strike, the agents still talked about eco-resorts and millennials because:

1. **Intro messages use generic metadata, not the actual brief**

   - The `generateConversationResponse` method only received:
     - `campaignType`: "general_campaign"
     - `targetMarket`: "general market"
     - `focusAreas`: ["general focus"]
   - It did NOT receive the actual campaign brief text

2. **The actual analysis DOES receive the brief correctly**
   - `analyzeAudience()` gets `campaignContext.originalBrief`
   - But by then, the intro message was already generated with generic content

## The Fix

Updated all three agents' `generateConversationResponse` methods to:

1. Accept `originalBrief` from the context
2. Include the actual campaign brief in the prompt for intro messages
3. Use the brief content instead of just generic metadata

### Before:

```javascript
const { campaignType, targetMarket, focusAreas, urgency } = context;
// ...
CONTEXT: You are participating in a collaborative PR strategy session for a ${campaignType} campaign targeting ${targetMarket} travelers.
```

### After:

```javascript
const { campaignType, targetMarket, focusAreas, urgency, originalBrief } = context;
// ...
CONTEXT: You are participating in a collaborative PR strategy session.
${originalBrief ? `CAMPAIGN BRIEF: ${originalBrief}` : `Campaign Type: ${campaignType} targeting ${targetMarket} travelers.`}
```

## Result

Now agents will:

- See the actual campaign brief (airline strike, eco-resort, etc.) in their intro messages
- Respond appropriately to the specific campaign content
- Not default to generic "millennials and eco-conscious travelers" responses

## Remaining Issues

1. **Mock data is still hardcoded** - External APIs are failing (401/404)
2. **Some phrases come from the brief itself** - If using the same eco-resort brief, you'll see similar themes
3. **Need real API keys** for News API, Google Trends, Social Media APIs to get dynamic content
