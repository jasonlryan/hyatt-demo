# Sequential Workflow Use Cases

## Use Case 1: New Eco-Resort Launch Campaign

### Step 1: Research & Audience Insights

A PR manager asks Research & Audience GPT: "What drives Millennials on a wellness getaway?" and receives bullet-point motivators showing that Millennials prioritize digital detox, personalized spa experiences, and environmental credentials. The manager identifies sustainable luxury as the key pitch theme for the target audience.

### Step 2: Validate with Current Trends

The manager then asks Trending News GPT: "Show me the top 5 wellness-travel headlines from the last 48 hours." The GPT provides today's hottest stories with one-sentence explanations of why each is trending. The manager discovers that "regenerative travel" is a hot topic, perfectly aligning with their eco-resort launch.

### Step 3: Execute with Story Angles

Finally, the manager asks Story Angles & Headlines GPT: "Give me 5 story angles for Hyatt's digital-detox retreats, plus 3 headline options each and the top 3 outlets per angle." The GPT delivers data-backed angles, attention-grabbing headlines, and a prioritized outlet list. The manager now has ready-to-send pitch bullets targeting the right media outlets to maximize placement for the eco-resort launch.

## Use Case 2: Repositioning an Existing Property

### Step 1: Research & Audience Insights

A marketing director asks Research & Audience GPT: "What factors influence Gen Z's hotel selection for urban weekend trips?" The GPT provides insights about Gen Z's preference for Instagram-worthy design, local cultural experiences, and tech-enabled convenience. The director decides to focus on the property's unique design elements and local connections.

### Step 2: Validate with Current Trends

The director consults Trending News GPT: "Show me the top 5 urban travel headlines from this week." The GPT returns current stories showing a surge in interest for "hyperlocal experiences" and "design-forward accommodations." This validates the repositioning strategy and adds timely elements to consider.

### Step 3: Execute with Story Angles

The director then asks Story Angles & Headlines GPT: "Give me 5 story angles for our redesigned Chicago property, with 3 headline options each and targeted lifestyle publication recommendations." The GPT delivers compelling angles highlighting the property's design collaboration with local artists, custom-curated neighborhood experiences, and tech innovations, complete with catchy headlines and ideal media targets.

## Use Case 3: Responding to Travel Industry Disruption

### Step 1: Research & Audience Insights

During a major airline strike, a communications manager asks Research & Audience GPT: "What concerns do business travelers have during travel disruptions?" The GPT provides data on business travelers' priorities: minimizing productivity loss, rebooking efficiency, and clear communication. The manager decides to focus on Hyatt's business continuity solutions.

### Step 2: Validate with Current Trends

The manager asks Trending News GPT: "Show me the top 5 headlines about the airline strike impact from the last 24 hours." The GPT delivers the most relevant stories, revealing that most coverage focuses on stranded travelers and lacks solutions. This identifies a narrative gap Hyatt can fill.

### Step 3: Execute with Story Angles

Finally, the manager asks Story Angles & Headlines GPT: "Give me 5 story angles about Hyatt's business traveler solutions during the airline strike, with 3 headline options each and top business media outlets." The GPT provides angles focusing on Hyatt's extended-stay accommodations, workspace solutions, and rebooking partnerships, with headlines framed as solutions to the current crisis and targeted to business publications.
