# PeakMetrics: The Complete Market Intelligence Solution for Natural Foods Brands

## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving natural foods market, brands need more than just social media monitoring—they need comprehensive market intelligence that spans competitors, regulations, trends, and crises. PeakMetrics delivers exactly that through its sophisticated workspace-based query system and real-time alerting capabilities.

## Beyond Simple Brand Monitoring

While traditional social listening tools focus on brand mentions, PeakMetrics transforms a single workspace into a comprehensive intelligence hub. For a natural foods brand like "Green Harvest Organics," this means monitoring not just their own mentions, but the entire ecosystem that affects their business.

## The Power of One Workspace, Multiple Query Variations

### **How It Works**

PeakMetrics uses a **workspace-based system** where you create one workspace with a primary query, then run multiple specialized queries against that workspace:

1. **Create Workspace**: Define one main search query (e.g., "Green Harvest Organics")
2. **Query Variations**: Run unlimited different filters and parameters against that workspace

### **Competitive Intelligence**

PeakMetrics enables natural foods brands to monitor competitors by querying their workspace with different filters:

```
"(title:Whole Foods OR text:Whole Foods) AND (title:organic OR text:organic)"
```

This query variation tracks what competitors are doing in the organic space, providing insights into market positioning and opportunities.

### **Regulatory Monitoring**

Stay ahead of compliance changes with queries like:

```
"(title:FDA OR text:FDA OR title:USDA OR text:USDA) AND (title:regulation OR text:regulation)"
```

This ensures brands are notified immediately when regulatory changes could impact their business.

### **Trend Detection**

Catch emerging trends before they go mainstream:

```
"(title:plant-based OR text:plant-based) AND (title:trend OR text:growth)"
```

This helps brands identify new product opportunities and market shifts.

### **Crisis Management**

Real-time crisis detection with queries like:

```
"(title:recall OR text:contamination) AND (title:organic OR text:natural)"
```

This provides immediate alerts for food safety issues that could affect the entire industry.

## Real-Time Alerting: The Game Changer

PeakMetrics' native alerting system eliminates the need for constant polling. Instead, brands can set up intelligent alerts that trigger based on:

- **Velocity spikes** when mentions accelerate rapidly
- **Sentiment shifts** when negative sentiment emerges
- **Keyword detection** for specific threats or opportunities
- **Volume thresholds** when mention counts reach critical levels

## Multi-Dimensional Intelligence

### **Geographic Targeting**

Monitor specific markets with geographic filtering:

```
"(title:California OR text:Los Angeles) AND (title:organic OR text:natural)"
```

### **Influencer Tracking**

Track celebrity and influencer endorsements:

```
"(title:Oprah OR text:Gwyneth) AND (title:organic OR text:natural)"
```

### **Supply Chain Monitoring**

Early warning for supply chain disruptions:

```
"(title:supply chain OR text:shortage) AND (title:organic OR text:natural)"
```

### **Seasonal Intelligence**

Track seasonal patterns and opportunities:

```
"(title:holiday OR text:seasonal) AND (title:organic OR text:natural)"
```

## The Technical Advantage

PeakMetrics uses Elasticsearch query syntax, providing natural foods brands with:

- **Field-specific searches** (title vs. text targeting)
- **Boolean logic** (AND/OR combinations)
- **Sentiment analysis** (positive/negative filtering)
- **Velocity tracking** (mention speed monitoring)
- **Multi-channel coverage** (news, social, blogs, video)
- **Real-time processing** (immediate intelligence)

## Business Impact

For natural foods brands, PeakMetrics delivers:

1. **Competitive Advantage**: Real-time insights into competitor activities
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Early warning for crises and regulatory changes
3. **Opportunity Identification**: Trend detection and market gaps
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Automated monitoring vs. manual research
5. **Strategic Planning**: Data-driven decision making

## Implementation Example

A natural foods brand creates one workspace, then runs multiple query variations against it:

```javascript
// Step 1: Create workspace with primary query
const workspace = {
  title: "Green Harvest Organics - Market Intelligence",
  query: "Green Harvest Organics OR \"Green Harvest\"",
  channels: ["news", "twitter", "reddit", "instagram"]
};

// Step 2: Run different query variations against the workspace
const competitiveQuery = "(title:Whole Foods OR text:Trader Joe) AND (title:organic OR text:natural)";
const crisisQuery = "(title:recall OR text:contamination) AND (title:organic OR text:natural)";
const trendQuery = "(title:plant-based OR text:vegan) AND (title:trend OR text:growth)";

// Each query variation runs against the same workspace with different filters
await service.getMentions(workspaceId, { filter_expression: competitiveQuery });
await service.getMentions(workspaceId, { filter_expression: crisisQuery });
await service.getMentions(workspaceId, { filter_expression: trendQuery });
```

Each query variation provides different intelligence from the same workspace data.
