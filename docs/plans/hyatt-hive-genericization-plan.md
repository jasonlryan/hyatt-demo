# ARCHIVED: This plan has been superseded by hive-orchestration-modernization-plan.md. Please refer to the new plan for all future work.

**Note:** This plan is the foundation for all further Hive orchestration work. Complete Phase 1 before starting the Hive workflow transformation (see hive-orchestration-transformation-plan.md).

## ✅ Phase 1: Genericize Hyatt Orchestrator (COMPLETED)

**What was accomplished:**

- Refactored campaign analysis methods to remove hard-coded hospitality logic and support dynamic detection for any industry/brand.
- Updated all Hyatt agent prompts to use [INDUSTRY], [BRAND_CONTEXT], etc. instead of hard-coded references.
- Updated context passing to inject industry, brandContext, and targetAudience into all agent calls and prompts.
- Unified deliverable display: all agent outputs (including research) now use a generic, markdown-friendly modal.
- Tested with hospitality and multiple new industries (e.g., remote work, tech, B2C/B2B), plus edge cases.
- Validated that Hyatt works for hospitality and new industries, with context injection and quality maintained.

**Success Metrics:**

- Hyatt is now industry-agnostic and works for any campaign brief.
- No hard-coded industry logic remains.
- All agent prompts and outputs are dynamic and context-driven.
- Deliverables are displayed consistently for all phases.

## Phase 2: Apply Genericization to Hive (**NEXT**)

- Use the validated approach from Hyatt to make Hive industry-agnostic before workflow transformation.
- Update Hive orchestrator, agent prompts, and context passing to match the new generic patterns.
- Test Hive with multiple industries and campaign types.
- See hive-orchestration-transformation-plan.md for the next steps.

**Remaining work for Phase 2:**

- Refactor Hive orchestrator and agents for dynamic context and prompt injection.
- Remove any hard-coded industry/brand logic from Hive.
- Validate with non-hospitality briefs and edge cases.
- Update documentation and test results for Hive.

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: (COMPLETED) Genericize Hyatt

- [x] Update Hyatt's campaign analysis to be industry-agnostic
- [x] Genericize Hyatt agent prompts
- [x] Update Hyatt context passing
- [x] Test Hyatt with generic prompts thoroughly

### Week 2: (IN PROGRESS) Apply to Hive

- [ ] Update Hive workflow for PR response
- [ ] Update Hive API for moment input
- [ ] Update Hive frontend for moment input
- [ ] Test complete Hive PR workflow

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Backward Compatibility:** Hyatt must work exactly as before for hospitality (✅ validated)
2. **Incremental Testing:** Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding (✅ for Hyatt)
3. **Rollback Plan:** Ability to revert changes if issues arise (in place)
4. **Validation Strategy:** Comprehensive testing with multiple industries (✅ for Hyatt, pending for Hive)

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 is complete.** Hyatt is now fully genericized and validated. Ready to proceed to Phase 2: genericizing Hive using the same approach.
